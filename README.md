## Configure tooling
- $ git config --global user.name "[name]"
> Sets the name you want attached to your commit transactions

- $ git config --global user.email "[email address]"
> Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions

## Create repositories
- $ git init
> Turn an existing directory into a git repository

- $ git clone [url]
> Clone (download) a repository that already exists on
GitHub, including all of the files, branches, and commits

## Branches
- $ git branch [branch-name]
> Creates a new branch

- $ git checkout [branch-name]
> Switches to the specified branch and updates the
working directory

-  $ git merge [branch]
> Combines the specified branchâ€™s history into the
current branch. This is usually done in pull requests,
but is an important Git operation

- $ git branch -d [branch-name]
> Deletes the specified branch

## Make changes

- $ git log
> Lists version history for the current branch

- $ git log --follow [file]
> Lists version history for a file, including renames

- $ git diff [first-branch]...[second-branch]
> Shows content differences between two branches

- $ git show [commit]
> Outputs metadata and content changes of the specified commit

- $ git add [file]
> Snapshots the file in preparation for versioning

- $ git commit -m "[descriptive message]"
> Records file snapshots permanently in version history


## Redo commits

- $ git reset [commit]
> Undoes all commits after [commit], preserving changes locally

-$ git reset --hard [commit]
> Discards all history and changes back to the specified commit

## Synchronize changes
- $ git fetch
> Downloads all history from the remote tracking branches

- $ git merge
> Combines remote tracking branch into current local branch

- $ git push
> Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub

- $ git push -u [remote]  [branch]


- $ git pull
> Updates your current local working branch with all new
commits from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub.
 git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge
